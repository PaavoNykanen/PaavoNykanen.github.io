              year old software developer currently living in Jyv채skyl채, Finland.
              I graduated from the University of Jyv채skyl채 with a Master of Science in Computer science in 2024.
              I also have a few years of work experience in the field of software development, mainly in full-stack development
              for client web applications and the dataplatform that they use. I am very eager to learn a lot more about software
              development and different technologies used for it, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to
              improve my skills. You can read more about my journey so far below or get in contact with me through the contact section!
